# Brand guidelines

## 1. Brand Lexicon (Our Naming)

To create a simple, memorable, and fun user experience, we will use a consistent set of names:

- **TweetBloom:** The name of the application. It combines "Tweet" (a short, brief idea, like a prompt) with "Bloom" (to grow, optimize, and flourish).
- **Bloom Buddy:** The name of our "Meta-AI" assistant. It is your **"Prompt's Brilliant Buddy"**—an intelligent, cheerful, and essential partner that helps you optimize your ideas. All intelligent outputs (Responses, Notes) are delivered by **Bloom Buddy**.

## 2. Positioning & Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

**Positioning:**

`TweetBloom` is not just another AI chatbot. It’s **"Your Prompt's Brilliant Buddy."**

In a crowded market of AIs competing on "who has the smartest answer," `TweetBloom` positions itself as the essential "Meta" layer that sits _before_ those AIs. It's the smart, cheerful sidekick that ensures you ask the right questions, helping you unlock the _true_ power of any AI tool you use.

**Unique Selling Proposition (USP):**

Your core USP is the **"Brilliant Boost" (The Blocking Optimization Flow)**.

> "While other apps send your vague `prompt` straight to a confused AI, `TweetBloom`’s `Bloom Buddy` cheerfully intercepts it. We give your idea a 'bloom'—polishing it into a `prompt` that _actually works_—before you even hit send. No more 'garbage in, garbage out.'"

**Supporting USPs:**

- **The "Idea Garden" Ecosystem:** This isn't just a chat app; it's a closed loop for creativity. You can instantly turn a great chat into a `Bud` (Note) and later combine those `Buds` into a brand new, fully-bloomed `prompt`.
- **Intentional Simplicity:** The 150-word and 7-reply limits are features, not bugs. They enforce the "Mobile First, Fast, Simple" mission, keeping interactions bright, brief, and effective.

## 3. Target Audience

Your documentation already identifies the core group (US-based, 25-45). We'll define them with our brand persona:

**Primary Audience: "The AI-Curious Explorer"**

- **Behavior:** They've tried ChatGPT or Gemini, but their results feel "meh." They know they're missing something and feel like they are "prompting wrong".
- **Pain Point:** They ask "give me marketing ideas" and get a boring, generic list. They feel uninspired and slightly intimidated by "prompt engineering".
- **Why TweetBloom?** The "Brilliant Boost" (Flow 1) is their secret weapon. `Bloom Buddy` acts as a coach that _shows_ them how to ask better questions, making them feel smarter and more capable.

**Secondary Audience: "The On-the-Go Creator"**

- **Behavior:** Young professionals, social media managers, and thinkers who live on their phones.
- **Pain Point:** Typing long, complex thoughts on a mobile keyboard is frustrating. They need to capture and synthesize ideas quickly.
- **Why TweetBloom?** The "Mobile First, Fast, Simple" mission is built for them. They love the speed of turning a chat into a `Bud` (Flow 4) and combining `Buds` into a new `prompt` (Flow 5) all while waiting in line for coffee.

## 4. Key Marketing Messaging

**Brand Slogan:** "Bloom Your Prompts – Faster, Smarter Tweets to AI."

**Theme 1: The "Meh" Problem (Addressing the Pain Point)**

- "Tired of boring AI `Buds`?"
- "Getting 'meh' from your AI? It's not the AI, it's the `prompt`!"
- "Stop getting robotic replies. Start getting brilliant `Buds`."

**Theme 2: The "Brilliant Buddy" (The Meta-AI Solution)**

- "Meet `Bloom Buddy`, your prompt's brilliant buddy! Our Meta-AI cheerfully polishes your ideas _before_ you send them."
- "Get a _wow_ `Bud` on the first try. Every time."
- **Show, Don't Tell (Example `Bloom Buddy` Responses):**
  - **User's "Bad" `prompt`:** "write an email"
  - **`Bloom Buddy`'s "Brilliant Boost" (Flow 1):** "Ooh, let's bloom that! How about: 'Draft a fun, friendly email to my team (3 people) asking for their lunch order for Friday. Mention the budget is $20 per person.' ... _Ready to send?_"
  - **User clicks "Improve Response" (on a `Bud`, Flow 2):** "Good start! Let's get even _more_ detail. Try this: 'That's great, but can you make the second point sound more enthusiastic and add a deadline of tomorrow EOD?'"

**Theme 3: The "Idea Garden" (The Simple, Fun Ecosystem)**

- "Your brain is fast. Your app should be too. (Mobile First, Fast, Simple)."
- "From tiny `prompt` to brilliant `Bud`. Instantly save chats as a new `Bud` (Flow 4)."
- "Combine your old `Buds` into your next big idea (Flow 5)."
- "Our 150-word limit keeps every `prompt` and `Bud` brief and bright."
